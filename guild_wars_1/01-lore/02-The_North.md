Devona brought her hammer crashing down on the head of a `devourer`.
> Девона обрушила молот прямо на голову `пожирателя`.

The creature's chitinous hide cracked under the impact, and one of its front legs buckled.
> Хитиновый панцирь чудовища треснул от удара, одна из передних лапок подломилась.

It was a solid hit, the sort that would bring even a seasoned soldier to his knees.
> Удар молотом был сокрушительным, способный сбить с ног даже опытного солдата.

But the monster Devona fought was no human.
> Но монстр, с которым сражалась Девона, вовсе не был человеком.

From what she could tell, these beasts didn't even feel pain.
> Судя по всему, такие существа вообще не чувствовали боли.

Barely staggered, the creature fought back.
> Едва покачнувшись от удара, чудище тут же контратаковало.

Its talons whistled as they cut the air, and Devona tried to dodge out of the way.
> Его саблевидные когти просвистели, рассекая воздух, и Девоне пришлось увернуться.

Twisting sideways, the hammer-wielding warrior moved quickly despite her heavy armor.
>

She was fast, but not fast enough.
>


Повернув корпус вбок, воительница быстро двигалась несмотря на тяжелую броню.

Она была быстрой, но недостаточно быстрой.

Понял вас. Давайте попробуем иначе, сохранив эмоциональность и динамичность сцены:

Она двигалась стремительно, однако зверь оказался проворней.

Или чуть подробнее:

Девона действовала молниеносно, но чудовище оказалось ещё быстрее.

Так лучше отражает темп боя и драматизм ситуации. Если нужны ещё варианты или изменения, сообщите.



The devourer's attack caught her shoulder, at the seam in her armor.
>

The scythe-blade talon skittered off the metal into the leather binding beneath.
>

Its razor-sharp tip punched through, and a flash of blinding pain ran down the left side of the warrior's body.
>

Pulling back and away, Devona took two steps, giving herself some room to recover.
>

The devourer shook its tails, the wicked barbed hooks at the tip of each dripping with a putrid, purple liquid.
>

The beast's beady little eyes twitched up and down, as if it were sizing her up.
>

Then the devourer skittered forward.
>

Devona's arm was still burning from the poisoned wound in her shoulder, and the creature's new attack was so swift that she was knocked back, tumbling over a pile of rubble.
>

The warrior dropped the head of her hammer to the ground, using the sturdy shaft as a crutch, righting herself.
>

But lowering her weapon left her open to another attack from the devourer.
>

The monster's mandibles clacked together, moving furiously as it bore down on the off-balance fighter.
>

Devona had managed to keep to her footing, but the devourer was now right on top of her.
>

The bright red fletching of an arrow sprouted in the creature's hide, punching through its already damaged front leg and pinning it to the ground.
>

The beast let out a high-pitched squeal, and Devona, seeing that her attacker had something else on its mind, took the opportunity to step out from underneath its talons.
>

As she turned, Devona caught sight of Aidan, perched atop a tectonic plate.
>

The ranger's long dark hair was held out of his face by a thick strap of leather, and his hard, brown eyes sighted down his bow.
>

Its string was pulled taut, a second red-fletched arrow already aimed at the crippled devourer.
>

To her left, Devona heard the deep voice of Mhenlo, speaking the last words of a prayer to Dwayna.
>

A cone of blue-white light enveloped the warrior.
>

Arcane energies coursed through her veins, and the burning in her shoulder suddenly subsided.
>

She couldn't see the monk, but she knew there would be time to thank him later.
>

Turning back, Devona watched the bug-eyed monster lift its ruined limb, pulling the shaft of Aidan's arrow through its flesh with a sickening pop and freeing itself.
>

Devona lunged forward. "Devour this," she shouted.
>

And her hammer fell once more.
>
